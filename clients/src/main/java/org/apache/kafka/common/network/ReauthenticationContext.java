// SECURITY: SEC-NET-013 (MEDIUM) Carries re-authentication state between old and new Authenticator instances.
// Why: Re-authentication context manages credential rotation
// for long-lived connections.
// The previous authenticator reference allows the new authenticator to close the old one after
// extracting any required state (e.g., subject, login context). The in-flight NetworkReceive
// (if present) is the SaslHandshakeRequest that triggered re-authentication — it must be
// forwarded to the new authenticator for processing.
// Risk: If the previous authenticator's credentials are not properly cleared during the swap,
// stale credentials could persist in memory longer than necessary.
// Improvement: Consider explicit zeroing of credential material in the previous authenticator
// after the new authenticator has extracted the needed state.
// Exploit: A re-authentication race could allow requests to be
// processed under the old principal during credential rotation.
